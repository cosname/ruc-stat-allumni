This page is intended to give you a feeling of what a blog post looks
like. Crab supports both fixed (static) pages as well as blog posts.

In order to make blog pages work correctly, you need proper permalinks
settings in your site's `config.toml`.

Hugo will then treat all files in the `blog` directory (for example)
like blog posts.

Have a look at the `config.toml` provided with this example site, as
well as [the page about Permalinks from the Hugo
docs](https://gohugo.io/extras/permalinks/).
